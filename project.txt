Pull a specific Docker image (e.g., nginx:latest).
Create a Docker container from that image.
Ensure the container is running and exposes a specific port (e.g., port 80).
Assumptions:
Docker is installed on the local machine where Ansible is running.
Ansible has the required privileges to interact with Docker.
